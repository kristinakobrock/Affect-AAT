# Affect-AAT

This repository accompanies my master's thesis in Cognitive Science. I designed and conducted a behavioral experiment called "Affect-AAT" that combines a mood induction procedure with an Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT)[1][2][3]. I collected reaction time data from 95 participants while they responded to positive and negative pictures via push and pull movements of a joystick. They completed this task after having taken part in a mood induction with short video sequences and were meant to elicit a positive or negative mood in the participants. Success of the mood induction was measured via PANAS questionnaires[4].

This repository contains the data in the 'data' folder and all preprocessing steps as well as the main statistical analyses. Some statistical model fits could not be uploaded to this repository because they have been too large, but they can be made available on request.
